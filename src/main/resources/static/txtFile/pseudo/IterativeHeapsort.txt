Function to Sift Down which takes in:
Input List, Root, Last Index.
    Set Current Index as Root.
    Loop while true:
        Set Left Index as Current Index time 2 plus 1.
        Set Right Index as Current Index times 2 plus 2.
        Set Largest Index as Current Index.

        If Left Index is less than Last Index and item at position Left Index of Input List is unsorted from item at position Largest Index of Input List:
            Set Largest Index as Left Index.
        
        If Right Index is less than Last Index and item at position Right Index of Input List is unsorted from item at position Largest Index of Input List:
            Set Largest Index as Right Index.
        
        If Largest Index is equal to Current Index:
            End loop.
    
        Swap item at position Current Index of Input List with item at position Largest Index of Input List.
        Set Current Index as Largest Index.

Function to perform Heapsort which takes in:
Input List.
    Set Input List Length as length of Input List.
    Loop i as Input List Length divided by 2 minus 1 and minus by 1 while greater than or equal to 0:
        Run Function to Sift Down using:
            Input List, i, Input List Length.
    
    Loop i as Input List Length minus 1 and minus 1 while greater than or equal to 0:
        swap item at position 0 of Input List Length with item at position i.
        Run Function to Sift Down using:
            Input List, 0, i.
