Function to Perform Partition which takes in:
Input List, Left Index, Right Index.
    Set Pivot Index as a number between Left Index and Right Index.
    Set Pivot Value as item at position Pivot Index in Input List.

    Set i as Left Index.
    Set j as Right Index.
    Loop while true:
        Loop while item at position i of Input List is less than Pivot Value:
            Increase i by 1.
        Loop while item at position j of Input List is greater than Pivot Value:
            Decrease j by 1.
        If i is greater than or equal to j:
            return j.
        Swap item at position i of Input List with item at position j of Input List.

Function to Perform Quicksort Logic which takes in:
Input List, Left Index, Right Index.
    If Left Index is greater than or equal to Right Index:
        End function.
