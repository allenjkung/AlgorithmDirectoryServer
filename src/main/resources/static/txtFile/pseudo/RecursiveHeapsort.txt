Function to Sift Down which takes in:
Input List, Root, Last Index.
    Set Left Index as Root time 2 plus 1.
    Set Right Index as Root times 2 plus 2.
    Set Largest Index as Root.

    If Left Index is less than Last Index and item at position Left Index of Input List is unsorted from at position Largest Index of Input List:
        Set Largest Index as Left Index.
    
    If Right Index is less than Last Index and item at position Right Index of Input List is unsorted from at position Largest Index of Input List:
        Set Largest Index as Right Index.
    
    If Largest Index does not equal Root:
        Swap item at position Root of Input List with item at position Largest Index of Input List.
        Run Function to Sift Down using:
            Input List, Largest Index, Last Index.

Function to perform Heapsort which takes in:
Input List.
    Set Input List Length as length of Input List.
    Loop i as Input List Length divided by 2 minus 1 and minus by 1 while greater than or equal to 0:
        Run Function to Sift Down using:
            Input List, i, Input List Length.
    
    Loop i as Input List Length minus 1 and minus 1 while greater than or equal to 0:
        Swap item at position 0 of Input List Length with item at position i.
        Run Function to Sift Down using:
            Input List, 0, i.
