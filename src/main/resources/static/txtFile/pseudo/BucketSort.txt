Set Bucket Count as desired amount of buckets to create.
Set Min Value as item of position 0 of Input List.
Set Max Value as item of position 0 of Input List.
Loop for Item in Input List:
    If Min Value is greater than Item:
        Set Min Value as Item.
    If Max Value is less than Item:
        Set Max Value as Item.
If Min Value equals Max Value:
    End function.
Set j as 0.
Set Buckets as an empty mutable array.
Set Steps as Max Value minus Min Value divided by Bucket Count.
If Steps is greater than 0:
    Loop i as 0 and increment to Bucket Count:
        Run function to add an empty mutable array in Buckets.
    Loop for Item in Input List:
        Set Bucket Key as floor of Item minus Min Value divided by Steps.
        Run function push Item into array at position Bucket Key in Buckets.
    Loop for Bucket in Buckets:
        Run function to sort Bucket.
        Loop for Item in Buckets:
            Set item at position j in Input List as Item.
            Increment j by 1.
Else:
    Set Bucket Count as Max Value minus Min Value.
    Set Buckets as a List of zeros the length of Bucket Count + 1.
    Loop Item in Input List:
        Increment position Item minus Min Value in Buckets by 1.
    Loop Bucket Id as 0 and increment to Bucket Count:
        Loop i as 0 and increment to item of position Bucket Id in Buckets:
            Set item as position j in Input List as Bucket Id plus Min Value.
            Increment j by 1.
