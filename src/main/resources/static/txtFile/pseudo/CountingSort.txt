Set Input List Length as length of Input List.
Set Largest Item as item of position 0 in Input List.
Loop i as 1 and increment up to Input List Length:
    If Largest Item is less than item of position i in Input List:
        Set Largest Item as item of position i in Input List.
Set Output List as a List of zeros the length of Input List Length.
Set Count List as a List of zeros the length of Largest Item plus 1.
Loop through each Item in Input List:
    Increase number at position of Item in Count List by 1.
Loop i as 1 and increment until greater than Largest Item:
    Increment Number of position i in Count List by the Number of position i - 1 in Count List.
Loop i as Input List Length minus 1 and decrement until less than 0:
    Set j as item of position i in Input List.
    Decrement Number of position j in Count List by 1.
    Set item of position number of position j in Count List in Output List as item of position i of Input List.
Copy Output List items into Input List.
