Function to Merge Input List which takes in:
Input List, Work List, Left Index, Middle Index, Right Index.
    Set i as Left Index.
    Set j as Middle Index.
    Set k as Left Index.
    Loop while i is less than Middle Index and j is less than Right Index:
        If item at position i of Work List is sorted to item at position j of Work List:
            Set item at position k of Input List as item at position i of Work List.
            Increase i by 1.
        Else:
            Set item at position k of Input List as item at position j of Work List.
            Increase j by 1.
        Increase k by 1.
    Loop while i is less than Middle Index:
        Set item at position k of Input List as item at position i of Work List.
        Increase i by 1.
        Increase k by 1.
    Loop while j is less than Right Index:
        Set item at position k of Input List as item at position j of Work List.
        Increase j by 1.
        Increase k by 1.
    Return Input List.
