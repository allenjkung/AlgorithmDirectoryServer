Function to perform Counting Sort which takes in:
Input List, Place Number.
Set Input List Length as length of Input List.
Set Output List as a List of zeros the length of Input List Length.
Set Count List as a List of zeros the length of 10.
Loop through each Item in Input List:
    Set Radix Value as reminder of Item divided by Place Number divided by 10.
    Increase number at position of Radix Value in Count List by 1.
Loop i as 1 and increment up to 10:
    Increment Number of position i in Count List by the Number of position i - 1 in Count List.
Loop i as Input List Length minus 1 and decrement until less than 0:
    Set Radix Value as reminder of item at position i of Input List divided by Place Number divided by 10.
    Decrement Number of position Radix Value in Count List by 1.
    Set item of position number of position Radix Value in Count List in Output List as item of position i of Input List.
Copy Output List items into Input List.

Function to perform Radix Sort which takes in:
Input List.
Set Input List Length as length of Input List.
Set Max Value as item at position 1 of Input List.
Loop i as 1 and increment up to length of Input List:
    If Max Value is less than item at position i of Input List:
        Set Max Value as item at position i of Input List.
Loop i as 1 and multiply by 10 while Max Value divided i is greater than 0:
    Run Function to perform Counting Sort using:
        Input List, i.
