Function to Merge Input List which takes in:
Input List, Work List, Left Index, Middle Index, Right Index.
    Set i as Left Index.
    Set j as Middle Index.
    Loop through Left Index to Right Index as k:
        if i less than Middle Index and (j greater than or equal to Right index or item at position i of Input List is sorted to item at position j of Input List):
            Set item at position k of Work List as item at position i of Input List.
            Increase i by one.
        Else:
            Set item at position k of Work List as item at position j of Input List.
            Increase j by one.

Function to perform Merge Sort which takes in:
Input List.
    Set Work List as copy of Input List.
    Set Input List Length of Input List.
    Loop i as 1 while i is less than Input List Length increasing by multiple of 2 per loop:
        Loop j as 0 while j is less than Input List Length increasing by i * 2 per loop:
            Set Middle Index as j + i if less than Input List Length or as Input List Length otherwise.
            Set Right Index as j + (i * 2) if less than Input List Length or as Input List Length otherwise.
            Run Function to Merge Input List using:
                Input List, Work List, j, Middle Index, Right Index.
        Set Input List as copy of Work List.
