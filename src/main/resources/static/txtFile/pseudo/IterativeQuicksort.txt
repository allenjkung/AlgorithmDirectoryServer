Function to Perform Partition which takes in:
Input List, Left Index, Right Index.
    Set Pivot Index as a number between Left Index and Right Index.
    Set Pivot Value as item at position Pivot Index in Input List.

    Set i as Left Index.
    Set j as Right Index.
    Loop while true:
        Loop while item at position i of Input List is less than Pivot Value:
            Increase i by 1.
        Loop while item at position j of Input List is greater than Pivot Value:
            Decrease j by 1.
        If i is less than or equal to j:
            return j.
        Swap item at position i of Input List with item at position j of Input List.

Function to Perform Quicksort which takes in:
Input List.
    Set Stack as a List with a List that has position 0 as 0 and position 1 as the length of Input List minus 1.
    Loop while Stack is not empty:
        Set Index List as the output of function to pop the latest List in Stack.
        Set Left Index as item of position 0 of Index List.
        Set Right Index as item of position 1 of Index List.

        If Left Index is less than Right Index:
            Set Pivot Index as output of Function to Perform Partition using:
                Input List, Left Index, Right Index.
            Run function to push into Stack a List that has position 0 as Left Index and position 1 as Pivot Index minus 1.
            Run function to push into Stack a List that has position 0 as Pivot Index plus 1 and position 1 as Right Index.
